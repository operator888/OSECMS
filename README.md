# OSECMS
Open Source Educational CMS.  

It's currently being made to teach the following concepts in order to create your own CMS: PHP Composer, PHP Autoloader, PSR-4, PDO, MVC OOP logic, Routing, SEO friendly URL's structure and implementation of encryption.

The reason for making one more "Simple CMS" from start, is because i want to study the aforementioned concepts, and although i did search thoroughly to find a CMS that implements all of the above and OOP coding patterns, i didnt found one.

So, the plan here is to not just write some classes and add some, 1 or 2 lines of comments but also do my best to fully explain every concept and also give you links for further studying about every concept.

For the time this is a personal project aiming to help me master these topic, and alongside maybe help some others too.
