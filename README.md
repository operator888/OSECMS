# OSECMS
Open Source Educational CMS.  

OSECMS is currently being developed to educate myself the following concepts, in order to create my own CMS: PHP Composer, PHP Autoloader, PSR-4, PDO, MVC OOP logic, Routing, SEO friendly URL's structure and implementation of encryption.

The reason for making one more "Simple CMS" from start, is because i want to study the aforementioned concepts, and although i did search thoroughly to find a CMS that implements all of the above, to get an example, i didn't found anything. 

So, the plan here is to not just write some classes and add some, 1 or 2 lines of comments but also do my best to fully explain every concept and also provide links for further studying about all used concepts.

For the time being this is a personal project aiming to help mastering these topics, and maybe help others too. :)

So, lets dive in!


This project is being made on a Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa and is using PHP 7.1.23 (cli) (built: Feb 22 2019 22:08:13) ( NTS )

I will list all the software libraries and frameworks used, the moment they will be used and not before. This way we can make small understandable steps and then move on.  

The 1st step to begin is to open up your favorite Terminal and create a new folder that will contain all of the software. (you could also use the GUI of your system and create a new folder or accomplish other parts of this guide, but thats up to you. My plan is to use the Terminal as much as possible, because thats an essential skill for any proffesional software developer that have to "get his hands dirty" and make things work).
