# OSECMS
Open Source Educational CMS.  Made to teach the following concepts in order to create your own CMS: PHP Composer, PHP Autoloader, PDO, MVC OOP logic, Routing, 

The reason for making one more "Simple CMS" from start, is because i want to study the aforementioned concepts, and although i did search thoroughly to find a CMS that implements all of the above and OOP coding patterns, i didnt found one.

So, the plan here is to not just write some classes and add some, 1 or 2 lines of comments but try my best to fully explain every concept and also give you links for further studying about every concept.
